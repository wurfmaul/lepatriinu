\subsection{\ttfamily BeatDetector}
Also \emph{BeatDetector} is an abstract class, thats purpose is to be the
superclass of all beat detection algorithms. It also accommodates an
enumeration, named \emph{Mode}, which allows to switch between three different
ideas and implementations of its only derived class
\emph{AutoCorrelationBeatDetector}:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{AUTO\_TEMPO\_CORRELATION} simply implements the idea of the pulse
  train, described on slides 5.15 through 5.19. To tackle the inaccuracy the
  list of onsets will always carry along we use a threshold, called
  \emph{AUTO\_PHASE\_TOLERANCE} which, after excessive testing we found best to
  be set around 0.21 and pushed it up to 48\% (average over all 18 provided data
  sets).
  \item \emph{AUTO\_ONSET\_CORRELATION} represents the implemenation of the IOI
  idea presented on lecture slides 5.10 through 5.14.
  \item \emph{AUTO\_SPECTRAL\_CORRELATION} was the attempt to improve the onset
  correlation by trying to reinterprete the formulas as to be the spectral data
  instead of the onsets. It didn't work out that well (less than 4\% over 18
  data sets).
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Best results}
As onset correlation did a rather poor job and spectral correlation an even
worse, we stuck with tempo correlation as the algorithm of choice.
