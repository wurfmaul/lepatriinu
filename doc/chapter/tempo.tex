\section{\ttfamily TempoExtractor}
\emph{TempoExtractor} is the abstract superclass of which all tempo extractors
should be derived.

\subsection{\ttfamily InterOnsetTempoExtractor}
As the name suggests, \emph{InterOnsetTempoExtractor} performs the Inter Onset
Intervals as described in the lecture slides 5.10 through 5.14.

The method calculates the most common gapsize between the onsets inside a set of
onsets. 

Because of the inaccuracy that evolves when adding vague real numbers, we
decided to use two \emph{HashMaps}, the first to map from the time point
where an onset meets a gapsize to
